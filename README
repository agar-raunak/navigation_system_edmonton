Running Instructions:

-After extracting the part2.zip folder, open a terminal in the main folder and write make.
	This will create executables in the server and client folder.Open the terminals 
	in the server folder and client folder, one in each. In the server folder's terminal, enter
	./server [port]. In the client folder's terminal, enter ./client [port] [server ip address]
	Thi will establish the connection between the server and client.
	After this, in the main folder's terminal, enter ./plotter. This will open up the plotter.
	You can select any 2 points on the plotter and it will show the way between them, if
	it exists. It it does not, then the plotter will reset and you can select new points.
	You can move around the plotter with "w" for up, "a" for left, "s" for down, "d" for right.
	You can also zoom in and out using q and e respectively.
	
	To call the program from the main directory's terminal. Open a total of 3 terminals.
	In the first one enter ./server/server [port]. In the second one enter
	./client/client [port] [server ip address]. In the third enter ./plotter.
	Please maintain this order to avoid any errors.

	If you want to exit out of the program, just click x on the top right of the plotter and it will close the
	connection between the client and server and, the extra files, which were opened by them 
	will also shut down.

	To get rid of all the executables, enter make clean in the main directory's terminal
